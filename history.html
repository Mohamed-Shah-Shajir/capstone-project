              <h2>Ancient History</h2>
              <p>In ancient times, Kuttikkanam and its surrounding areas were dense forests inhabited by indigenous tribes, such as the Malayaraya 
                community. These tribes lived off hunting, gathering, and primitive agriculture. The region was part of the larger Tamilakam, 
                influenced by the Chera dynasty, which ruled Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The dense forests of Kuttikkanam were also known for their 
                biodiversity, including medicinal plants used in Ayurveda.</p>

              <h2>Medieval History</h2>
              <p>During the medieval period, Kuttikkanam was under the control of local chieftains and later became part of the Thekkumkur kingdom.
                 Thekkumkur rulers controlled large parts of central Kerala, including Kottayam and parts of Idukki. However, in the 18th century, 
                 Marthanda Varma, the ruler of Travancore, expanded his kingdom by defeating Thekkumkur. Under Travancore rule, Kuttikkanam 
                 remained a remote forested region but gradually gained significance as trade routes passed through nearby areas.</p>

              <h2>Modern History</h2>
              <p>Kuttikkanam gained prominence in the 19th century when the British and local Travancore rulers developed it as a plantation hub. 
                John Daniel Munro, a British official, played a key role in establishing tea, coffee, and cardamom plantations. 
                The region became a summer retreat for the Travancore royal family, with Sri Moolam Thirunal and other royals frequently visiting. 
                Peermade, near Kuttikkanam, also became a European settlement with churches and colonial buildings. </p>
                <p>Post-independence, Kuttikkanam continued to thrive as a plantation area, but it also developed into a tourist destination. 
                Today, it is known for its scenic beauty, cool climate, and attractions like Parunthumpara, Valanjanganam Waterfalls, and 
                the nearby tea estates.</p>
